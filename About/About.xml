	<description>Four new combat orientated servants, totally not necromantic abominations. Bonewalkers and bonelords have no needs, need no training, and feel no pain. They are also highly aggressive, and will spend all day chasing around hostile targets if given the chance, all while respecting zones of course. They are all crafted at the new bonewalker forge, each one requiring a corpse, and some additional materials. Skill requirements for crafting them are somewhat high, but totally-not-necromancy isn't something everyone is capable of.\n\n-Supports Vanilla Achievements Expanded\n-Based on the 'Elder Scrolls' series by Bethesda Game Studios
